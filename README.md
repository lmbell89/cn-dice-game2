Dice Game 2 - a CodeNation Task

The Brief: <br>
Create a dice game for 2 players. Each player starts their turn by rolling the die. <br>
If they roll a 1 their turn ends and play moves to the next player. <br>
If they roll more than 1, that number is added to their current points. <br>
The player can then choose to roll again or hold (bank) their points. <br>
If the player rolls again and gets a 1, they lose all of their current points (but not their held points) and their turn ends. <br>
Players may roll the die as many times as they like. <br>
The first player to get 20 held points wins. <br>
