Dice Game 2 - a CodeNation Task

The Brief:
Create a dice game for 2 players. Each player starts their turn by rolling the die. 
If they roll a 1 their turn ends and play moves to the next player.
If they roll more than 1, that number is added to their current points.
The player can then choose to roll again or hold (bank) their points.
If the player rolls again and gets a 1, they lose all of their current points (but not their held points) and their turn ends.
Players may roll the die as many times as they like.
The first player to get 20 held points wins.
